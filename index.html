                In a world of code where snowflakes fall,<br>
                Christmas cheer lights up us all.<br>
                The Rolling Stones play a rocking tune,<br>
                Under the glow of a festive moon.<br><br>
                Engineers design, create, and build,<br>
                With dreams of gadgets to be fulfilled.<br>
                Lines of Python, sparks, and gears,<br>
                Celebrate the season with joyous cheers.<br><br>
